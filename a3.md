# Part D: Reflections


## Reflection for Shrey Patel - 158379214

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

Ans : # MinHeap Class

For this assignment, I created a Python class called `MinHeap` that implements a min-heap data structure. The class provides methods for inserting elements into the heap, getting the minimum element without altering the heap, extracting the minimum element from the heap, checking if the heap is empty, and getting the number of elements in the heap. The heap is initialized with an optional input array during instantiation. The `insert` method ensures that the min-heap property is maintained after inserting elements. Overall, the class allows for efficient management and retrieval of minimum elements in a heap-based data structure.

2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

Ans : One valuable thing I learned while doing this assignment was the importance of maintaining the heap property. In a MinHeap, it is crucial to ensure that the parent nodes have smaller values than their child nodes. This property allows for efficient extraction of the minimum element and maintains the heap's structure.


3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

Ans : The most challenging aspect of this assignment was debugging the initial implementation to pass all the provided test cases. The errors were related to the incorrect functioning of the `_downheap` and `_upheap` methods, which are essential for maintaining the heap's properties. To overcome this challenge, I carefully reviewed the logic of these methods and the overall implementation. I used print statements and manual tracing to understand the code execution flow and identify problematic areas. The error messages from the test cases helped me narrow down the issues and make the necessary corrections. Through iterative testing and debugging, I successfully fixed the implementation and ensured that the class passed all the provided tests. This experience helped me improve my problem-solving and debugging skills in Python.

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

Ans: # generate_maze function

I began the assignment by importing the required modules, including random, the Graph class from a2d, and the minimum_spanning_tree method from a3_partb. The generate_maze function, which has two parameters named numRows and numCols, was then created. I determined the total number of cells in this function, built walls between adjacent cells, made a graph, distributed edge weights at random, found the minimal spanning tree using Kruskal's approach, and then generated a list of final walls. After removing non-minimum spanning tree walls, I ran the main program to evaluate the maze generating process and printed the resulting maze structure.


3. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

Ans: The use of Kruskal's approach to determine a graph's minimum spanning tree is one potential lesson to be learned from studying the code. A linked, undirected network with weighted edges can be solved using Kruskal's algorithm, a fundamental graph theory idea. With the help of this code, you can see how Kruskal's method may be used to build a maze by identifying the paths that connect all cells while reducing the overall path weight.

In situations like creating mazes, this project demonstrates the useful application of graph algorithms. It demonstrates how crucial it is to comprehend graph theory ideas and how they may be used to a variety of issues, such as the design and optimization of mazes.


3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

Ans: Using Kruskal's approach to determine the maze graph's minimal spanning tree was the most difficult part of the assignment to comprehend and implement. In order to overcome this difficulty, I carefully examined the algorithm's underlying ideas, divided the steps into smaller, more manageable chunks, thoroughly tested and troubleshot my implementation using smaller graphs, sought advice from online resources and communities, and iteratively improved my code based on comments and my own observations. As a result, I was able to implement the algorithm for creating the maze successfully.



## Reflection for Ruchi Patel (Id: 159426212)

1. Please detail what exactly **you** did for the assignment.

Ans: For the assignment, I implemented a minimum spanning tree algorithm using Kruskal's approach. Kruskal's algorithm helps find the minimum spanning tree of a connected graph by considering edges in ascending order of their weights. To start, I created two classes: Graph and DisjointSet. The Graph class handled the representation of the graph's vertices and weighted edges. On the other hand, the DisjointSet class was crucial for efficiently managing the connectivity of graph components. It involved methods for locating the representative element of a set and performing unions of sets. With these classes in place, I implemented the minimum_spanning_tree function using Kruskal's algorithm. This involved sorting the edges by weight, iterating through them, and adding edges to the minimum spanning tree while avoiding cycles.

  
2. What was one thing **you** learned when doing this assignment?

Ans: One significant thing I learned during this assignment was how Kruskal's algorithm works and how it efficiently finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph. I gained a deeper understanding of graph algorithms and how to manage the connectivity of graph components using the disjoint-set data structure.
   
3. What was its most challenging aspect and what did **you** do to overcome this challenge?

Ans: The most challenging aspect was implementing the disjoint-set data structure correctly and ensuring efficient operations like locating the representative element and performing unions. Handling the complexities of path compression and union by rank required careful consideration. To overcome this challenge, I referred to various resources that explained the disjoint-set data structure in detail. I carefully implemented the DisjointSet class, paying attention to the locate and union methods. Debugging and testing were crucial in making sure the operations worked as expected. I also took a step-by-step approach, focusing on understanding each part of the algorithm and verifying its correctness before moving forward.
